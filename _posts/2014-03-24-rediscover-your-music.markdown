I've had the same iTunes library since 2008 when I purchased my first MacBook.
This is great because I have metadata of every song I've played through iTunes in the last 6 years.

I've devised a Smart Playlist for finding songs I've forgotten about.

I call this playlist _Old_.

Match _all_ of the following rules:

- Last Played not in the last 6 months
- Plays is greater than 5
- Last Skipped not in the last 3 months
- Time is greater than 1.00 (this is to get rid of intro/skit songs)

I generally wait for the playlist to get to around 100 songs then start listening to it.
I've remembered some great artists and albums through this playlist.

Happy rediscovering!
